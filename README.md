# pbrengine
A WIP PBR rendering engine.

The assets included to test the engine are not web optimized, they will be slow to load on the live version. (About 15-20 seconds, tops).

It might be worth it to clone this repo and run it locally. 

Some browsers do not work, one that I know does work is Firefox 87 on Linux.
